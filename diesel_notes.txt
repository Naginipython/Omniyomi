added diesel & dotenv, and a dependency.diesel_migration to cargo.toml

installed diesel-cli: cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features sqlite

made a .env file, added this: DATABASE_URL=db.sqlite

ran these commands:
diesel setup
diesel migration generate create_library
diesel migration generate create_chapters

added create table stuff to up in both
added drop table stuff in down to both

applied them with: diesel migration run

created a schema: diesel print-schema > src/schema.rs
This auto does work that I would need to do

Then I need to define the models, in database.rs. Also an insert data model
